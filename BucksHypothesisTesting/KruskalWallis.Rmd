# Reading in the Dataset
We start off by reading the `.csv` file into a dataframe. This will allow us to perform the necessary operations 
needed to extract the data that we're concerned about, as well as perform the statistical tests, which can give us 
more insights into the data. 

**Note:** it is worth noting that we apply the bonferroni correction to all of our testing as well as set the 
signifigance level to 0.05.

```{r setup, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(rlang)
library(gridExtra)

# reading in the account data into data frames
account_2023 <- read.csv("C:/GitHub/BucksHackathon25/BucksDatasets/AccountLevel_2023.csv")
account_2024 <- read.csv("C:/GitHub/BucksHackathon25/BucksDatasets/AccountLevel_2024.csv")

# reading in the account/seat data into data frames
account_seat_2023 <- read.csv("C:/GitHub/BucksHackathon25/BucksDatasets/ALSL_2023.csv")
account_seat_2024 <- read.csv("C:/GitHub/BucksHackathon25/BucksDatasets/ALSL_2024.csv")


```

## Kruskal Wallis Test on AvgSpend and FanSegment
Now that we've read the data into a data frame, we would like to perform a kruskal wallis test on the AvgSpend vs the FanSegment from both datasets. This
will allow us compare a numerical variable against a categorical variable with multiple values. 

- **Null Hyypothesis:** the distribution of average spending is the same across all segments
- **Alternative Hypothesis:** atleast one fan segment has a different distribution of average spending compared to others

```{r}

# performing a kruskal-wallis test
kruskal_one <- kruskal.test(AvgSpend ~ FanSegment, data=account_2023)
print(kruskal_one)


```

Since we got our p-value as 2.2 x 10^-6, this means we reject the null hypothesis, as there is strong evidence to suggest that atleast one fan segment 
has a different distribution of average spending compared to others. To figure out which fan segments, we move to performing a post-hoc pairwise test.

```{r}

# setting the data type as factor
account_2023$FanSegment <- as.factor(account_2023$FanSegment)


# performing the pair wise testing
rank_sum_one <- pairwise.wilcox.test(
    x = account_2023$AvgSpend, 
    g = account_2023$FanSegment, 
    p.adjust.method = "bonferroni")

# printg out the results
print(rank_sum_one)


```

As we can see, we now know that the FanSegment groups that show a statistically significant difference is as follows:

- F vs A, B, C and D
- G vs A, B, C, D and E

Now we perform the same kruskal-wallis testing on all features in 2024 dataset.

```{r}

# performing a kruskal-wallis test
kruskal_two <- kruskal.test(AvgSpend ~ FanSegment, data=account_2024)
print(kruskal_two)

# setting the data type as factor
account_2024$FanSegment <- as.factor(account_2024$FanSegment)

# performing the pair wise testing
rank_sum_two <- pairwise.wilcox.test(
    x = account_2024$AvgSpend, 
    g = account_2024$FanSegment, 
    p.adjust.method = "bonferroni")

# printg out the results
print(rank_sum_two)


```

As we can see, we now know that the FanSegment groups that show a statistically significant difference is as follows:

- E vs A, C and D 
- F vs A and D 
- G vs A, B, C, D, E and F


## Creating a Function for Performing Kruskal-Wallis Tests
Understanding the Kurskal-Wallis process, we decide to make a function that will make the process a whole lot easier

```{r}

# function for performing kruskal-wallis testing
run_kruskal_wallis <- function(dataset, response, group) {

    # performing the kruskal wallis test
    formula <- as.formula(paste(response, "~", group))
    kruskal_result <- kruskal.test(formula, data=dataset)
    print(kruskal_result)

    # accessing the p-value
    if(kruskal_result$p.value < 0.05) {
        cat("\n p-value is significant, running pairwise wilcox test \n")
        rank_sum_two <- pairwise.wilcox.test(
        x = dataset[[response]], 
        g = dataset[[group]], 
        p.adjust.method = "bonferroni")
        print(rank_sum_two)
    } else {
        cat("\n p-value is not significant \n")
    }

}

# testing out the function
run_kruskal_wallis(account_2024, 'AvgSpend', 'FanSegment')

```

## Kruskal Wallis Test on SocialMediaEngagement and BasketballPropensity
Next, we move on to performing the Kruskal-Wallis test on SocialMediaEngagement vs BasketballPropensity. As SocialMediaEngagement is a categorical 
feature with three distinct values of Low, Medium and High, we set the null and alternative hypothesis as follows:

- **Null Hypothesis:** the distribution of average propensity is the same across all engagement groups
- **Alternative Hypothesis:** atleast one engagement category has a different distribution of propensity compared to others

```{r}

# running the kruskal-wallis test for the 2023 dataset
run_kruskal_wallis(account_2023, 'BasketballPropensity', 'SocialMediaEngagement')

# running the kruskal-wallis test for the 2024 dataset
run_kruskal_wallis(account_2024, 'BasketballPropensity', 'SocialMediaEngagement')


```

## Kruskal Wallis Test on FanSegment and DistanceToArena
Next, we move on to performing the Kruskal-Wallis test on FanSegment vs DistanceToArena. As FanSegment is a categorical feature with multiple distinct 
features, we set the null and alternative hypothesis as follows:

 - **Null Hypothesis:** the distribution of distance to arena is the same across all fan segment groups
 - **Alternative Hypothesis:** atleast one fan segment has a different distribution of distance compared to others

```{r}

# running the kruskal-wallis test for the 2023 dataset
run_kruskal_wallis(account_2023, 'DistanceToArena', 'FanSegment')

# running the kruskal-wallis test for the 2024 dataset
run_kruskal_wallis(account_2024, 'DistanceToArena', 'FanSegment')


```

For the 2023 dataset, we interpret the results as follows:

## Kruskal Wallis Test on AvgSpend and SocialMediaEngagement

 - **Alternative Hypothesis:** atleast one engagement has a different distribution of average spending compared to others

```{r}

# running the kruskal-wallis test for the 2023 dataset
run_kruskal_wallis(account_2023, 'AvgSpend', 'SocialMediaEngagement')

# running the kruskal-wallis test for the 2024 dataset
run_kruskal_wallis(account_2024, 'AvgSpend', 'SocialMediaEngagement')


```

## Kruskal Wallis Test on FanSegment and GamesAttended
Next, we move on to performing the Kruskal-Wallis test on FanSegment vs GamesAttended. As FanSegment is a categorical feature with 
multiple distinct features, we set the null and alternative hypothesis as follows:

 - **Alternative Hypothesis:** atleast one fan segment has a different distribution of games attended compared to others

```{r}

# running the kruskal-wallis test for the 2023 dataset
run_kruskal_wallis(account_2023, 'GamesAttended', 'FanSegment')

# running the kruskal-wallis test for the 2024 dataset
run_kruskal_wallis(account_2024, 'GamesAttended', 'FanSegment')


```

 - **Alternative Hypothesis:** atleast one tier group has a different distribution of DistanceToArena compared to others

```{r}

# running the kruskal-wallis test for the 2023 dataset

## Creating a Function for Box Plots

to visualize them into box plots to see how they compare.

```{r}

# declaring the library
library(ggplot2)

# defining function for plotting a box plot
plot_box_plot <- function(dataset, response, group, vector, title, year) {
    
    # converting group to symbol
    group_sym <- sym(group)

    # filtering out the data 
    filtered_data <- dataset %>%
        filter(!!group_sym %in% vector)
    
    
    filtered_data[[group]] <- factor(
        filtered_data[[group]],
        levels = vector
    )

    # plotting out the box plots
    p <- ggplot(filtered_data, aes(x = .data[[group]], y = .data[[response]])) +
        geom_boxplot(fill ="#00471B") +
        labs(title = title, x = group, y = response) +
        theme(
            panel.background = element_rect(fill = "#EEE1C6", color = NA),
            plot.background  = element_rect(fill = "#EEE1C6", color = NA),
            panel.border     = element_rect(color = "black", fill = NA, linewidth = 0.8),
            panel.grid.major = element_blank(),
            panel.grid.minor = element_blank()
        )

    # creating the filename
    filename <- paste0("C:/GitHub/BucksHackathon25/BucksHypothesisTesting/KruskalWallisPlots",year, 
    "/",title, ".png")

    #saving the plot in a directory
    ggsave(filename, plot = p, width = 6, height = 4, dpi=300, bg='white')
}

```
